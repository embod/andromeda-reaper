# Andromeda Reaper

The reaper is a very basic model for controlling mbots in the andromeda environment.
Essentially the bots move forward at a constant rate towards the first food that it has detected.
If there is poison detected closer than the food, the mbot will change it's heading.

## Use the reaper as a starting point

The reaper is designed to be the simplest possible model to help with building models for embod.ai
Feel free to fork the project and make modifications.
